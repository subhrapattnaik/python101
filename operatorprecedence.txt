What is Operator Precedence?

Operator precedence is the order in which operators in an expression are evaluated. Arithmetic operators in Python are evaluated similar to the arithmetic operator precedence you've learned in school, PEDMAS.

You can use parentheses to override precedence of operators.
Operator Precedence

Expressions will evaluate operator in this order, from first to last (highest precedence to lowest):
Type 	Operators
parentheses 	()
exponent 	**
multiply/divide 	*, /, %
addition/subtraction 	+, -
comparison 	<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=
negation 	not
logical-and 	and
logical-or 	or
assignment 	=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
