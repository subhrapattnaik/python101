it is a software library stored in what is called a Python module. In this case, the module is called turtle, and it contains a large set of functions 
for moving a virtual turtle around a screen.
\

----------------------------
We will teach you several useful turtle functions in this lesson, but if you want to learn more,
you can check out the official Python turtle API here.

\
---------------------------

turtle produces output on a graphics canvas, rather than as text to the console. There are many different ways to produce output, 
such as tactile, audio, visual, or text.
\
------------------------------------

In order to use turtle graphics, you must import the turtle module. 

\

screen = turtle.Screen() # get the turtle screen

\
screen.bgcolor("blue")
\



----------------------------------------
t = turtle.Turtle() #create a new turtle
t.shape("square")

\

import turtle
screen = turtle.Screen()
screen.bgcolor("green")
t = turtle.Turtle() #create a new turtle
t.shape("arrow")
#circle,square,arrow,triangle etc....
