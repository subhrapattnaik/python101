use the break command to stop a while loop before it ends naturally. 

# If condition2 becomes true while the loop is running, break stops the loop.
while (condition1):
    if (condition2):
        break
        
-------------------------------

# If condition2 becomes true while the for loop is running, break stops the loop.
for i in range(number):
    if (condition2):
        break
        
        
------------------------------------
