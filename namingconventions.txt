Naming Conventions



rules for writing good Python code.

variable and function names always start with lowercase letters.
If a variable or function name has several words, 
you'll still want to make everything lowercase. And instead of using spaces, separate words with underscores.
Here are some examples of snake case:

    game_over
    the_largest_one
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    Reserved Words:
    
    Reserved words are special commands that are built into the Python language. Because they already have special meanings to Python, you can't use them to name things.

Some common reserved words and their uses are:

    def: Declare a function
    for: Create "for" loops
    if: Create "if" statements
    else: Create "if-else" statements
    while: Create "while" loops
    break: Break out of loops
    class: Declare a class definition
----------------------------------------------------------------------
forward() 	Moves the character one step forward.
fire() 	Launches an arrow that travels 5 steps forward.
jump() 	Makes the character jump over a gap and land on the other side.
turn_left() 	Turns the character to the left.
turn_right() 	Turns the character to the right.

-----------------
fire()
jump()

Use ''' to start and end multi-line comments like so:

    Identifiers cannot have spaces in them.
    Identifiers must begin with a letter, or an underscore _. They can't begin with numbers!
    Identifiers can use letters and numbers.
    Identifiers cannot contain symbols such as exclamation marks (!), hyphens (-), periods (.), commas (,), and so forth.
    You can use uppercase letters, but Python doesn't treat uppercase and lowercase letters the same. In other words, jump, JUMP, and jUmP are not the same identifier to Python!
