1. Conditions:							
First condition Full-Time							
Second condition GPA Greater than 4.5							
2. Results:							
Gets a discount – return “Yes", otherwise “No"							
The following formula is a great example of how to use Nested If in this case. 							
=IF(B9="Full-Time",IF(B10>4.5,"Yes","No"),"No")							
Alternatively, you could switch between the first and the second conditions:							
=IF(B10>4.5,IF(B9="Full-Time","Yes","No"),"No")							
There are many other ways you could test 2 or more conditions! We believe that the two examples above are the easiest =)
