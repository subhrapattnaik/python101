A while loop executes the same code again and againâ€”as long as the specified condition is true.

The while loop has the following syntax:

while (condition):

    commands ...

The condition determines how long the loop will continue to execute. For example, you might use a condition like i < 10. 
This says keep those commands in the while loop running, as long as the value of i is less than 10.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
example:

i = 0
while (i < 10):
    print(i)
    i+=1
    
   Let's use a while loop to count from 0 to 9. You need to initialize the variable i = 0 outside the while loop and
   increment the variable using the line i +=1 at the bottom of the loop.

The condition in this case is i < 10. Click on the run button to see how it works. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # print numbers from 3 to 1
i = 3
while (i >= 1):
    print(i)
    i-=1
print("Liftoff!!!")

-------------------------------------
while loop to print all odd numbers from 0 to 20 in ascending order. 

i = 0
while (i <= 20):
    if (i%2 != 0):
        print(i)
    i+=1
